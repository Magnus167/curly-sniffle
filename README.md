## TODO

### done
- Create a list of black points, and sort them by angle by converting them to polar coordinates.

- From those black points, establish "lines" by locally grouping coords by gradient. 

- Get start and finish points, and find a way to arrange such that it completes a loop.

- A line is stored as a list of points, and a point is added by checking if it has the same gradient.

### left
- create a method to identify loops
